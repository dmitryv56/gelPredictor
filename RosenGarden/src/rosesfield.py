""" Task: write a class which receives
    - the field size;
    - the coordinates of all already purchased squares;
    - the coordinates and cost of all squares with cost different than zero;
    - the coordinataes and #roses of all squares with at least a single rose;
    - the desired garden shape (H,W).

    For any given garden shape and budget, the class should be able to calculate coordinates(r,c) such that the
    axis-aligned rectangle of shape H*W with its top-left corner located at (r,c),
    - is fully containede in the field,
    - costs at most the budget,
    - do not contain any already purchased squares, and,
    - the number of roses is maximal.

    The class should implement IRoseField interface.

    This class implements the IRosesField interface (__init__, set_garden_shape,find_best_garden) and several methods
    like as fields_info2matrix, find_squares, total_report.

    The flow behavior:
           - for given rose location and cost dictionaries the "matrix"-view  (list of lists) are created. It is
           algorithmically more  convenient to shift (right and down) the "garden"-rectangle over "field"-rectangle than
           to use a sparse dictionary. The input data for task is more convenient to define as sparse dictionaries. The
           "dict to matrix" transformation is carried out on init stage and do not influence to performence.

           - the complexity of garden search O(.) in the worst case no more
           (field_width -garden_width+1) * (field_height -garden_heaigth+1)  or O(n)<n^2.

           - the gardens with cost more than a budget are ignored.

           - from several identical solutions one is selected closest to "nordwestern" corner.

           - all generated sequences of squres with amount roses ana costs are logged in "main.log"

           - only "nordwestern" corner (row,column) for garden sequence si put on terminal.
